This is an introduction web page to working with forms, databases, and jQuery

Some information:
- This repository includes everything from Chapter 8 to Chapter 14
- Payment is a separate html, therefore, it has its own mainpayment.js, dialogbox.js, and payment.js
- Remotedatastore is included as comments, current application is for local datastore
- Dialog as a class results in an error where "this.$element.append(rowElement.$element);" doesn't work, therefore, it was converted to function
- any syntax errors were fixed with ESLint
